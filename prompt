Brief: """Create a python3 project which generates an attractive story, then generate a natural audio that reads this story, then generates an image for this story. In the end, a video will be generated using the audio and image, and the video will eventually be uploaded to YouTube for the purpose of profiting""",
Note: """In the following context, when I mention an OpenAI model, I need you to use the model's API properly""",
Requirements of this project:
[
"""Create 2 AI agents, writer and reviewer. Both agents uses the OpenAI GPT-4o model as the source of intelligence""",
"""Writer agent proposes a list of ideas for the story; then the reviewer agent reviews the ideas and provides comments and give a score for the attractiveness of each proposed idea; the writer agent revises the ideas based on the reviewer agent's responses and shows the revised ideas to the reviewer agent again. This process may iterate multiple times until a satisfying and detailed idea is finalized and agreed by both agents""",
"""The writer agent composes an outline of this finalized story idea, and the reviewer agent comments, and the writer agent revises. This process may iterate multiple times until a satisfying and detailed idea is finalized and agreed by both agents""",
"""The writer agent composes the full story of this finalized story outline, and the reviewer agent comments, and the writer agent revises. This process may iterate multiple times until a satisfying full story is finalized and agreed by both agents""",
"""Create an AI agent called artist using OpenAI dall-e-3 model, which draws an eye-catching and attractive image for this story""",
"""Create an AI agent called speaker using OpenAI tts-1-hd model, which reads the whole story into an audio using attractive and young female sound""",
"""All generated products are to be stored inside the project directory locally with proper names"""
